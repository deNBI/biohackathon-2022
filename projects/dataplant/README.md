# DataPLANT - Facilitating Research Data Management to combat the reproducibility crisis

This page describes the "DataPLANT - Facilitating Research Data Management to combat the reproducibility crisis" project for the 1st de.NBI /
ELIXIR Germany BioHackathon.

## Abstract

Well maintained research data according to the FAIR principles will benefit everyone. To push towards this goal, we at DataPlant propose the Annotated Research Context (ARC), a FAIR research object based on exisiting standards like ISA, CWL and RO-Crate.

A lot of effort went into writing tools and documentation for creating ARCs. Here at the Hackathon, we aim to further integrate these tools with the biological research community, providing our interfaces through openly available REST APIs. 

Additionally, making the annotation and storing of experimental data as a researcher as frictionless as possible is another goal. For this, findability and quality of the training materials is being improved.

## Topics

* Plant Sciences
* ARC
* ISA
* Swate
* Documentation
* Templates
* Interoperability
* MIAPPE

## Expected audience

* Bioinformaticians with an interest in FAIR Data management
* Plant biologists

## Communication

* Project lead: Lukas Weil <weil@bio.uni-kl.de>
* Project lead: Elisa Senger <e.senger@fz-juelich.de>

## Possible outcomes

* Functioning integration of MIAPPE wizard with Swate ontology service
* Functioning integration of MIAPPE wizard with ArcCommander import functionality
* MIAPPE template for Swate
* Centralized DataPlant tool documentation
